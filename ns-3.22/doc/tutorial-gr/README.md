## Make Instructions
In order to generate the [ns-3 tutorial](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.22/tutorial/html/index.html) in Greek, 
follow these three steps:
* Go via terminal or open a terminal in the current directory, `/tutorial-gr`.
* Enter `make` to see the available options. The only option that runs flawlessly for the Greek language is `html`.
* Enter `make html` to build the tutorial into standalone HTML files.
When it's done, the generated HTML files will be in the `/html` folder of a newly created `/build` directory.
